## Polymorphism
 polymorphism enables you to write programs that process objects that share the same superclass (either directly or indirectly) as if they’re all objects of the superclass; this can simplify programming

Consider the following example of polymorphism.
Suppose we create a program that calculates the interest rates of several types of bank accounts. Classes Checkingaccou, Frog and Bird represent the types of animals under investigation. Imagine that each class
extends superclass Animal, which contains a method move and maintains an animal’s current
location as x-y coordinates. Each subclass implements method move. Our program
maintains an Animal array containing references to objects of the various Animal subclasses.
To simulate the animals’ movements, the program sends each object the same message
once per second—namely, move.
