## Polymorphism

Polymorphism enables you to write programs that process objects that share the same superclass (either directly or indirectly) as if theyâ€™re all objects of the superclass; this can simplify programming.

Subclasses of a class can define their own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class.

To demonstrate polymorphic features in the Java language, let us create an ```Animal``` class having a ```talk``` method and extend it with a ```Cat``` and a ```Dog``` class. For ```Animal```, the talk method simply throws an exception, which indicates the method has not yet implemented. For ```Cat```, override the ```talk``` method to return ```"Meow!"```. For ```Dog```, override the method to return ```Woof!```.

```java
class Animal {
    
    String talk() {
       throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Animal has not implement talk");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    String talk() {
        return "Meow!";
    }
}
 
class Dog extends Animal {
    String talk() {
        return "Woof!";
    }
}
```

As Cat is a subclass of Animal, Java allows an object of type Animal to point to an object of type Cat.
Hence, it is possible to write:
```java
Animal c = new Cat();
```
Now the object ```c``` is capble of calling every method in Animal class. But when you call ```c.talk()```, the actual method being applied is that of the ```Cat``` class. So, ```c.talk()``` will return the string ```"Meow!"```.
The following snippet demonstrates it.

```java
public class AnimalTest {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal[] pets = new Animal[3];
        pets[0] = new Cat();
        pets[1] = new Dog();
        pets[2] = new Animal();
        for (int i = 0; i < pets.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(pets[i].talk());
        }
    }
}
```
The above code produce
```
Meow!
Woof!
Exception 
```

## Abstract class

## A complete example
Suppose we create a program that calculates the interest rates of several types of bank accounts. Classes CheckingAccount and SavingAccount represent the types of accounts. Each class extends superclass BankAccount, which contains general methods such as deposit, withdraw and apply interest rate at the end of month. Each subclass implements its own version of the method ```ApplyInterestRate```. Our program maintains an array containing references to objects of various BankAccount subclasses. 
At the end of month, the program traverse the array and tell the object to apply interest rate. To each object, the instruction is the same: apply interest rate. But how the tasks are carried out varies depending on the class of the object. This programming paradigm is called polymorphism.
